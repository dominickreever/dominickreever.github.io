            <h1>Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio site hosted by GitHub Pages.</h1>
            <p>My name is Dominick Reever and I’m a self-taught, 22 year old web developer. I created this simple web app to showcase a multitude of skills I’ve learned over the past couple of months, thanks to multiple collaborative online resources.</p>
            <p>Aside from my passion for the web, I enjoy reading, running, and playing board games.</p>
            <p>If you’re interested in learning more about me, working together, or helping me improve this site, please feel free to contact me through the Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, or email links on the homepage. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
