            <h1>Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio site hosted by GitHub Pages.</h1>
            <p>My name is Dominick Reever and I’m a self-taught, 22 year old web developer. I created this simple web app to showcase a multitude of skills I’ve learned over the past couple of months thanks to free online resources such as freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and MDN Web Docs.</p>
            <p>Aside from my passion for the web, I enjoy reading, running, playing board games, and watching low-budget films.</p>
            <p>If you’re interested in learning more about me, working together, or helping me improve this site, please feel free to contact me through the Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, or email links on the homepage. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
