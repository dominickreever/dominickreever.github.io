            <h1>Hello! Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio site hosted by GitHub Pages.</h1>
            <p>My name is Dominick Reever and I’m a self-taught, 21 year old web developer. I created this simple web app to showcase a multitude of skills I’ve learned over the past couple of months thanks to free online resources such as freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and MDN Web Docs.</p>
            <p>While I’m currently working full-time as a Warehouse Technician at Pierson Computing Connections Inc., it is my hope to one day work in the web technologies industry. Until then, I’ll continue to use my  free time to grow my knowledge base and work on new projects.</p>
            <p>Aside from work and my passion for the web, I enjoy reading, running, and playing chess.</p>
            <p>If you’re interested in learning more about me, working together, or helping me improve this site, please feel free to contact me through the Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, or email links on the homepage. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
