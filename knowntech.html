        <h1>Here's a list of the web technologies I've worked with in the past, my perceived skill level, and an explanation of my exposure with them.</h1>
            <br>

            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <h3 class="intermediate">Intermediate</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>I first learned HTML a few years ago when I was introduced to the world of web development and programming. At the time, I used w3schools and Codecademy to teach myself basic concepts and begin experimenting.</p>
                    <p>After a short hiatus, I returned to the markup language a few months ago. It was relatively easy to pick up again, and through the help of freeCodeCamp, have since employed it in the use of various small projects.</p>
            
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <h3 class="intermediate">Intermediate</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>I was exposed to CSS shortly after my first experiences with HTML through the same resources. At first, I only learned positioning and coloring. Once I returned to my studies, I encountered animations and responsive web pages. I have since used it to style multiple projects.</p>
            
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Javascript</h2>
                <h3 class="basic">Basic</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>I’ve been studying Javascript since returning to my studies in web development. Resources such as freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and MDN Web Docs have been a huge help in understanding, arguably, my first programming language.</p>
                    <p>The language itself has afforded me the opportunity to learn about programming in general. The different types of languages, data types, approaches in design, different coding environments, APIs, frameworks, etc. have all been introduced to me, and inspired further learning.</p>
                    <p>I’ve utilized it in some small projects.</p>
            
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Git/GitHub</h2>
                <h3 class="basic">Basic</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>I first made a GitHub account a few years ago when I first started learning the basics of the web. Only recently have I learned the difference between Git and GitHub, and its value in developing projects individually and as a team.</p>
                    <p>This website is my first attempt at using these services.</p>
           
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>
                <h3 class="basic">Basic</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>I began using Visual Studio Code shortly after my introduction to Javascript.</p>
                    <p>All of the code written for this website originated in Visual Studio Code.</p>
           
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Browser Developer Tools</h2>
                <h3 class="intermediate">Intermediate</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>My first encounter with browser developer tools was at a young age when I happened across them on Internet Explorer. Since those first encounters, I’ve learned much more about these tools’ practical uses.</p>
                    <p>I’ve used both Chrome and Firefox web tools to help in researching how the internet and various sites work behind the scenes.</p>
            
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Command Line Interface</h2>
                <h3 class="basic">Basic</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>Like most people, I was first exposed to the command line interface through Hollywood films that included genius hacker archetypes. My first actual use of the program came many years later when I decided to configure a dual-boot of Windows and Ubuntu on my personal laptop.</p>
                    <p>After focusing on web development, I’ve used it considerably more often. Managing directories and files, formatting partitions, Git, npm, etc. have all been crucial to staying organized and efficient through my education and projects.</p>
            
                <h2>Other</h2>
