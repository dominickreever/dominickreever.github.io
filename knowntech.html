        <h1>Here's a list of the web technologies I've worked with in the past, my perceived skill level, and an explanation of my exposure with them.</h1>
            <br>

            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <h3 class="intermediate">Intermediate</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>I first learned HTML a few years ago when I was introduced to the world of web development and programming. At the time, I used w3schools and Codecademy to teach myself basic concepts and begin experimenting.</p>
                    <p>After a short hiatus, I returned to the markup language a few months ago. It was relatively easy to pick up again, and through the help of freeCodeCamp, have since employed it in the use of various small projects.</p>
            
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <h3 class="intermediate">Intermediate</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>I was exposed to CSS shortly after my first experiences with HTML through the same resources. At first, I only learned positioning and coloring. Once I returned to my studies, I encountered animations and responsive web pages. I have since used it to style multiple projects.</p>
            
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Javascript</h2>
                <h3 class="intermediate">Intermediate</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>I’ve been studying Javascript since returning to my studies in web development. Resources such as freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and MDN Web Docs have been a huge help in understanding my first programming language.</p>
                    <p>The language itself has afforded me the opportunity to learn about programming in general. The different types of languages, data types, approaches in design, different coding environments, APIs, frameworks, etc. have all been introduced to me, and inspired further learning.</p>
                    <p>I’ve utilized it in some small projects.</p>
            
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Git/GitHub</h2>
                <h3 class="intermediate">Intermediate</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>I first made a GitHub account a few years ago when I first started learning the basics of the web. Only recently have I learned the difference between Git and GitHub, and its value in developing projects individually and as a team.</p>
                    <p>This website is my first attempt at using these services, but it won't be the last.</p>
           
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Browser Developer Tools</h2>
                <h3 class="intermediate">Intermediate</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>My first encounter with browser developer tools was at a young age when I happened across them on Internet Explorer. Since those first encounters, I’ve learned much more about these tools’ practical uses.</p>
                    <p>I’ve used both Chrome and Firefox web tools to help in researching how the internet and various sites work behind the scenes, as well as debugging purposes.</p>
            
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Command Line Interface</h2>
                <h3 class="intermediate">Intermediate</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>Like most people, I was first exposed to the command line interface through Hollywood films that included genius hacker archetypes. My first actual use of the program came many years later when I decided to configure a dual-boot of Windows and Ubuntu on my personal laptop.</p>
                    <p>After focusing on web development, I’ve used it considerably more often. Managing directories and files, formatting partitions, Git, npm, etc. have all been crucial to staying organized and efficient through my education and projects.</p>
            
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
                <h3 class="intermediate">Intermediate</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>I've utilized the CSS framework Bootstrap for a range of previous projects. I found its ease of use and versatility a great asset in quick and responsive design.</p>

            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>React</h2>
                <h3 class="basic">Basic</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>After feeling comfortable with Javascript, I recently started looking into various libraries for the language. React was one of the first I encountered, and have since used it in creating a productivity app.</p>

            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>jQuery</h2>
                <h3 class="basic">Basic</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>With some experience in React and realizing the wide range of projects it's incorporated into, I recently began experimenting with jQuery.</p>

                    <p>I have since used this library in making a random quote generator.</p>

            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Angular</h2>
                <h3 class="basic">Basic</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>Angular is the most recent front-end tool I've experimented with and have utilized it in the creation of a bookstore app. My experience building with this framework also allowed me to become more familiar with Typescript.</p>
            
            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>Node/Express</h2>

            </div>
                    <p>In an attempt to understand web development more completely, I've looked into back-end functionality and production with Node and the popular library Express.</p>
                    <p>I've used both technologies in a local library application.</P>

            <div class="header-grid">
                <h2>MongoDB</h2>
                <h3 class="basic">Basic</h3>
            </div>
                    <p>As any data-driven web application requires a database, I've delved into the world of MongoDB to learn about NoSQL programs, models, and CRUD design.</p>
                    <p>I've utilized MongoDB in a local library application with Node and Express.</p>
